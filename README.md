#Introduction to the project

Our project looks at the abundance changes of salamanders in the Bruce Peninsula. The goal of this project is to figure out and investigate the possible environmental/abiotic factors that may result in the changes of abundance for these salamander populations. We chose to do this project as it may provide an insight into how and why salamander abundance changes over time and it may also be used as a predictive dataset as we look to compare a prediction of population numbers to actual amounts that may exist.

#Description of the data
The data looks at salamder abundance in the Bruce Peninsula, and the possible variables which we might use in the dataset include: year, salamander count, precipitation in the last 24 hours (mm), air temperature, soil temperature, beaufort sky class, beaufort wind class, soil moisture and soil pH. The data was collected by surveyors of the land and the population from 2004-2013. The data will answer our research questions by providing insight into the factors that might effect the population.

We all have varying skills and strengths within R coding and beyond and we have chosen that no one will be given a particular role but instead we will act as one big conglomerate of roles with everybody being responsible for everything. Everyone can be a leader and notetaker and organiser depending on the situation.
