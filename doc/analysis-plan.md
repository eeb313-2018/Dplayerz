#Possible analyses
   - Using multivariate, like MANOVA or PCA and univariate methods like linear regression to test whether there are       correlations between one or more variables.
  - Randomization tests to simulate missing values and make projections for abundance 
  - Time series analysis 
  
  
#Possible results tables

 - Tables of MANOVA 
- Tables for PCA analysis 
- Tables for Regression coefficients and P-values

 #Possible results figures
 
 - Graph of abundance over time
- Visualizations of graphs of Linear regressions
